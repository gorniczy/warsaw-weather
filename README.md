The project is built on the belief that people may bond with their physical surroundings through digital tools that appear to take them away from the analogue world. Its very pragmatic nature - showing weather - reminds people of the outside. It then brings this environment closer to users allowing them to look at their neighborhood in a new way. It may be used through mobile/desktop devices or displayed in public spaces, e.g. inside or outside of the administrative buildings.
